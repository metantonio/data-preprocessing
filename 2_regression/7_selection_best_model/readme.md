This folder will be used to evaluate wich regression model performs better.

The dataset cointains 4 independant parameters:
AT: Amgen Temperature
V: exhaust vacum
AP: ambient pressure
RH: relative humedity

And a dependat variable:
PE: Power Energy

Data has been already data preprocessed: no missing data, no categorical data.

The idea is to make the model that better fits to data and be able to predict the Power Energy given new data, have the better conditions with certain fixed parameters, etc...
